## Cost for solar power plant

Here is an overview of the typical capital costs for a 1MW solar photovoltaic power plant:

* Solar modules - $0.5 - $0.6 million for crystalline silicon panels rated at 5W per sqft.
* Inverters - $50,000 - $100,000 for grid-tied inverter system and controls.
* Mounting system - $50,000 - $150,000 for fixed tilt or tracking mounts.
* Electrical equipment - $50,000 - $100,000 for transformers, switchgear, monitoring.
* Site preparation - $50,000 - $100,000 for grading, access, perimeter.
* Installation labor - $50,000 - $100,000 depending on complexity.
* Permitting and engineering - $50,000 - $100,000.
* Total: Approximately $800,000 to $1.2 million.

The wide range accounts for differences in site location, labor rates, type of PV panels, mounting system and other factors. Economies of scale provide some cost savings for larger utility-scale systems.

1MW solar PV power plant expressed in terms of cost per square meter:

* Solar modules - $100 - $120 per sqm. Crystalline silicon panels are typically rated at 200W per sqm.
* Inverters - $10 - $20 per sqm. Sized based on peak capacity.
* Mounting system - $10 - $30 per sqm. Depends on mounting type.
* Electrical equipment - $10 - $20 per sqm.
* Site preparation - $10 - $20 per sqm. Grading and access roads.
* Installation labor - $10 - $20 per sqm. Based on crew size.
* Permitting/engineering - $10 - $20 per sqm.
* Total: Approximately $160 to $250 per sqm.

The total PV system size for 1MW is typically 4000 - 5000 sqm depending on the solar irradiance availability.

> +- 0.05 USD per kwatth, which is very good but thats only for when its sun.

> +- 0.08 USD per kwatth, which is still very good, but only 40% of capacity usable when there is no SUN

## Land needed

Here are some conservative estimates for the land area needed for a 5 MW solar PV facility in Africa:

* Assume a location in sub-Saharan Africa with an average solar insolation of 5.5 kWh/m2/day
* Use a conservative capacity factor of 15% for the solar PV system
* A solar panel with 20% efficiency and 1 m2 area will produce on average: 5.5 kWh/m2/day x 0.2 efficiency = 1.1 kWh per day 1.1 kWh/day x 365 days x 0.15 capacity factor = 61.2 kWh per year
* So each 1 m2 of solar panels will generate about 61.2 kWh per year
* The solar facility needs to generate 5 MW x 24 hours x 365 days = 43,800 MWh per year
* So total solar panels needed: 43,800,000 kWh / 61.2 kWh/m2 = 715,195 m2
* Add ~20% extra land for spacing, access roads etc.
* Total land area required: 715,195 m2 x 1.2 = 858,235 m2
* Which is 86 hectares or 0.86 km2

So for a 5 MW solar PV facility with a 15% capacity factor in sub-Saharan Africa, a conservative estimate is around 86 hectares or 0.86 km2 of land area.

If we only need it for 8 hours, then we can do â…“



* We need 300,000m2 land for solar for the datacenter


## Zanzibar suitable?

Here are a few factors that indicate Zanzibar has relatively good suitability for solar energy production:

- Solar Irradiation - Zanzibar receives average solar insolation of around 5.5-6.0 kWh/m2 per day. This is considered a good level of solar resource for photovoltaic electricity generation.
- Close to Equator - At around 6 degrees South latitude, Zanzibar's location close to the equator provides consistent solar exposure throughout the year.
- Low Rainfall - The archipelago experiences lower rainfall amounts compared to other tropical regions. This allows for more days of direct sun exposure for solar panels versus cloudier areas.
- Land Availability - As an archipelago, land area is limited for large-scale solar farms. But the islands have ample unused land that could host small- to medium-scale solar developments. Rooftop solar also has significant potential.
- Growing Electricity Demand - Zanzibar has an emerging economy with increasing power demand that could benefit from distributed solar generation to supplement the grid.
- Decreasing Solar Costs - The global decline in solar PV costs makes adoption more feasible compared to past years.
- Supportive Policies - Tanzania has begun establishing policies like tax exemptions and net metering that can incentivize solar generation.

## sunlight per day

Here are some details on the average amount of sunlight per day in Zanzibar that is usable for solar energy:

- Zanzibar has an equatorial location off the east coast of Africa and receives abundant sunlight throughout the year.
- Average peak sun hours per day (hours with direct sunshine) is around 6-7 hours.
- For solar photovoltaic (PV) panels oriented appropriately, the average daily solar irradiation is about 5.5-6.0 kWh/m2.
- This solar irradiation includes both direct and diffuse sunlight. PV panels can utilize both components for electricity generation. 
- Assuming a conservative 15% conversion efficiency for solar panels, the average usable sunlight is around 0.825 - 0.9 kWh/m2 per day.
- More advanced solar cell efficiencies up to 22% could provide over 1.2 kWh/m2 of usable electricity generation per day.
- Seasonal variation in usable sunlight is low due to Zanzibar's equatorial location. Output is fairly consistent throughout the year.
- Some cloud cover and humidity during the April-May rainy periods can slightly reduce usable sunlight.

So in summary, Zanzibar benefits from excellent solar resources with approximately 6-7 peak sun hours and 5.5-6 kWh/m2 of daily irradiation. After accounting for real-world system efficiencies, on average 0.8 - 1.2 kWh/m2 of this sunlight can be utilized daily for electricity generation using solar photovoltaic panels.
