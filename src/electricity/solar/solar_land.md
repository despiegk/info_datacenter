# land size reuired for solar

The size of land required to generate 1 megawatt-hour (MWH) of solar energy depends on several factors, including the efficiency of the solar panels, the solar irradiance at the location, and the climate conditions. Here's a rough estimate based on typical values:

1. **Solar Panel Efficiency**: The efficiency of solar panels varies, but let's assume an average efficiency of around 15-20%.
2. **Solar Irradiance**: The amount of sunlight energy received at a particular location also varies. Let's consider an average value of around 5 kWh/m²/day.

With these assumptions, you can estimate the size of land required using the formula:

```
Land Area (in square meters) = Energy Required (MWh) / (Solar Panel Efficiency * Solar Irradiance)
```

Converting the energy from MWh to kWh:

```
1 MWh = 1000 kWh
```

Let's plug in the values:

```
Land Area (m²) = (1000 kWh) / (0.15 * 5 kWh/m²/day)
```

Calculating:

```
Land Area ≈ 13333.33 m² or 1.33 hectares (since 1 hectare = 10000 m²)
```

So, based on these assumptions, you would need approximately 1.33 hectares of land to generate 1 MWh of solar energy per day. Keep in mind that this is a simplified estimate, and actual requirements may vary based on location-specific factors, panel efficiency, and other considerations.
